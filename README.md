Ideapad 300-15 ISK High Sierra 10.13.6 
======================================
Confirmed to work flawlessly on 10.13.6
At this point only DSDT.dsl and SSDT-2-CB-01.dsl (GFX0->IGPU rename) should be used, other tables are more or less useless.

Notes
=====
Built-in wifi won't work, I use TL-WN725N nano usb dongle, work better than this noteboot built-in wifi.

TODO
====
* Try to integrate ELAN touchpad driver. Right now there's no multitouch.
* Make screen backlight work full-scale.
